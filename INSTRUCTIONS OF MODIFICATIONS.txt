Below is the description of the functionality of each one of those threads.
 
 	 •Thread 1 –it needs to sort the numbers in Buffer in descending order. Once the numbers are sorted, it prints out the array.
 
	 •Thread 2 –it finds the largest number in Buffer, and calculates its factorial. It prints the array, the largest number, and its factorial.
 
	 •Thread 3 –it calculates the average of the numbers in Buffer. Itprints the array, and the average value of its numbers.
